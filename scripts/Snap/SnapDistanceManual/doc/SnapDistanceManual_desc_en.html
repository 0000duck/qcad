<p>This tool allows you to snap to a point that is between two points, or a
given distance from the first point, at an angle defined by the second point.
You enter the value in the snap distance box, and then choose 'Distance',
'Percent', or 'Fraction' from the dropdown box. This command does not restrict
the distance, percent or fraction entered. Therefore a distance greater than
the distance between the two points will return a point beyond the second
point. Similarly a percentage greater than 100, and a fraction greater than 1
will return a point beyond the second point. You can also enter a negative
value. This will return a point before the first point. (Note: You can enter
fractions as '1/7', or '3/11' for example.)</p>
